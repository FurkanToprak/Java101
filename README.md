# Java 101

This is the syllabus for Furkan Toprak's Java 101 class. This class is built by an Undergraduate Computer Science Student, for students. I built the material and subjects for the course in the order that I saw fit based on what had confused me when I was first learning Computer Science.

## Homework: 
Each lesson has a homework task attached at the very end. Please complete this material before proceeding to the next lesson.
