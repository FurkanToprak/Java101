# Lesson 5 | Libraries and Math in Java:
## Libraries:
Let's picture that we have become Java programmers and that we specifically love making games in Java that include cars. It would be quite a repetitive task to have to code a car class every time. Instead, we should just code a `Car` class once and _reuse_ the code. This is where libraries come in.

Libraries allow for **reusability** of code. Libraries are collections of code that provide classes with useful attributes for the programmer. We store our useful libraries within **packages**. Packages are collections of codes. For our example, let's call our package `useful_package`. Let's say that the `Car` class exists within a `Car.java` file within the package. If we wanted to use that code, we would have to **import** it. Here's how to import an item from a package:
```Java
// The format is import <package>.<class>
import useful_package.Car;
```
Now, once we've imported the library, we can now use it. We'll use a real-world example next section.

## Math in Java:
Before we proceed with this course, let us think about why we _need_ computers. Computers are very good at _computing_. This is why the first applications for computers were used for mathematics. Similarly, to be able to use computers to their fullest capabilities, we must learn how math works in programming and in Java specifically. Let's get started.
